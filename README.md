Hi, this is my perosnal portfolio. You can find the live version here: https://ryanj14.github.io/react-portfolio/

It's written in React.js.

I'm currently implementing a blog functionality into my portfolio using RESTful API. It's almost done!
I'm not using Redux-form so everything is in an uncontrolled state, in regards to my form handling.

The technologies being used:

- JSON server: prototyping my API
- Redux/React-redux: Storing them into a state/object for better handling
- lodash: 
  - I use the GET call and store the results into an array
  - Omit to remove an entry from my object
- PHP: Login functionality just for me so no one else can create a blog.

Things I want to possibly add:
  - MySQL: Overkill this login functionality and check to see if my login credentials match on the database.
  - Docker/Kurbernetes: Deploy it these way as oppose to using Github pages.

I'm not even sure, at the time of writing this, it's possible for my blog can do http requests from Github pages.
