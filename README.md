# react-portfolio
A React.js build version of my static portfolio page.

The source code is in the "develop" branch. I didn't know that my master branch would loose its source code to build files.
I'll clean up my repo in the future.

I wanted to take my exsisting portfolio web page and convert it to a react.js app.

Technologies used in this project:
- React.js
- HTML5
- Sass
- Bootstrap
